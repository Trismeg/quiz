1. Mass of photon is 0.
2. The size of a quark is 1/100000000 (atom)
3. Color charge is a property of quarks and gluons that is related to the particles' strong interactions, but electric charge is the physical property of a matter that causes to experience force, when it is placed in electromagnetic field.
4. Boson is a particle that have multiple versions of itself in the same quantum statel however fermion is a particle that can only have one state (spin) at a siven moment.
5. Quark; charm
6. Bubble chamber is used to detect ellectrically charged particles moving through it.
7. Leptons appear to be point-like particles without internal structure. They have no electrical charge and very little mass.
8. Electron and muon; quark and antiquark.
9. Quark, antiquark, electron and proton.
10. An exchange particle is something that interacts with ordinary particles in order to produce the effect of attraction or repultion.
